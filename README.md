# 💡 Learning about SOLID Principles & Clean Code 💻

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to the **Learning about SOLID Principles & Clean Code** project!

This repository is dedicated to learning and understanding two fundamental concepts in software development: SOLID principles and clean code practices.

**SOLID principles** are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Each principle addresses a different aspect of software design and, when applied together, they help create more robust and scalable software systems.

**Clean code** refers to writing code that is easy to understand, read, and maintain. It emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and consistency in coding practices, making it easier for developers to collaborate and for projects to evolve over time.
